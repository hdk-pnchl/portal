When most people hear the word psychotherapy, they immediately imagine a patient lying on a couch talking while a therapist sits in a nearby chair jotting down thoughts on a yellow notepad.
<br><br>
While many psychotherapists do use this classic type of talk therapy, there are actually a wide variety of techniques and practices used in psychotherapy. 
<br>
The exact approach used in each situation can vary based upon a variety of factors, including the training and background of the therapist, the preferences of the client and the exact nature of problem the client is experiencing.
<br><br>
Some of the major approaches to psychotherapy include:
<br>
<b>Psychoanalytic:</b> An approach to therapy that involved delving into a patients thoughts and past experiences to seek out unconscious desires or fantasies.
<br>
<b>Cognitive-behavioral:</b> A type of psychotherapy that involves cognitive and behavioral techniques to change negative thoughts and maladaptive behaviors.
<br>
<b>Humanistic:</b> A form of therapy that focuses on helping people maximize their potential.
<br><br>
Psychotherapy and Counselling are professional activities that utilize an interpersonal relationship to enable people to develop self-understanding and to make changes in their lives. 
<br>
Here, we work within a clearly contracted, principled relationship that enables individuals to obtain assistance in exploring and resolving issues of an interpersonal, intrapsychic, or personal nature.

Psychotherapy is no longer restricted to medical and clinical background. With a drastic rise in an individual's mental disturbance, psychotherapy has branched out in almost all fields. Corporate world is one major part of it. The atmosphere and antisocial relationship between employees gives a direct impact on their work output.
<br><br>
Other more personal individual issues may also hold a company back. Lack of an employee’s confidence in work-related and presenting situations can make the difference between a successful project and a failure. A small number of psychotherapy sessions could be all it will take to improve an individual’s confidence. 
<br><br>
Non work-related personal issues will often affect a sufferer’s work performance as well as their private life. By helping them to control the way they feel to manage their workload and working relationships alongside their private life, we will have overcome the issues. 
Poorly organized team building exercises and coaching is well intentioned but can intensify the issues that already exist. These types of session are usually developed by people who have spent their careers in a business environment. Though their corporate insight is useful, my experience in person-centered psychology focuses on the individuals’ and the group’s dynamic. Productivity and financial success will follow naturally from a happy and confident workforce. 
Apart from individual counselling, we also take group therapy sessions heading to their own advantages.
<br><br>
<b>Group Therapy</b>:
<br><br>
Our group therapy sessions can take a variety of forms. Often, a group of related or acquainted individuals recognize a problem with their relationship and seek to resolve it. Another popular and extremely useful type of group therapy happens when we bring together a group of people who’ve never met but suffer in similar ways. We find that it is incredibly helpful to all involved in these sessions as group members get encouragement from the others in the session. 
<br><br>
For some members, group sessions can be more helpful than individual sessions as there is no pressure to speak or take part in the activities. We understand that it can sometimes take time to feel comfortable in a therapy session which is why we won’t pressurize you to participate until you are ready. 
<br><br>
Group therapy sessions are especially helpful to members who lack confidence in group situations. From time to time we all have to take part in activities in a group when it is the last thing we want to do. For some, the lack of confidence can be stifling and can halt social progress. We’ve found that members of our group psychotherapy sessions have gained social skills and confidence as a result of the therapy. 
<br><br>
Many people have found it beneficial to take part in both individual and group therapy sessions. Though you will not be obliged to do this, we will explore every possibility to achieve the desired outcomes from your psychotherapy.
